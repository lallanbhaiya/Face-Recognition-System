# Face-Recognition-System
Detects the face of the person if present inside the Database using the KNN algorithm.

Create a Folder named 'Data' where you put the codes.
Also, keep the file "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" in the same folder as well.

This project uses the KNN technique to identify the faces and draws a box around the identified faces with the name of the person identified on the top of it.
